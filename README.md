## Prerequisites
* Docker for Windows, Linux or Mac
* Code Editor: Checkout [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [SublimeText](https://www.sublimetext.com/)

## Installation
1. Clone this repo: ```git clone https://github.com/markvillar/tlgc-docker.git```

2. Create a new Environment file ```.env``` in the root folder.

## Optional
3. Edit ```settings.py``` and your domain/ip to ```ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['yourhostipordomain']``` - if you're going to production.
